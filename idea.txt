I came accross a concept called organic visualization from a link on slashdot.
the example they gave was the visualization of project development, where
files are associated with developers. the files are free-floating particles
that are allowed to float toward the developers that are working on them. 

I would like to create a similar real-time visualization where packets flow
toward and away from ips. This needs to be associated with both a source and a
destination, so that you can plainly see the different flows. This project
cannot visualize as many ips as the full visualizer can, because it would be
chaotic, but it would be interesting to visualize it for a small subnet, or
even an individual computer. 

so... things that are necessary:
	a simple particle manager:
		particles move toward a destination, but avoid each other, thus they
		need to be aware of each other. there needs to be a strucure that
		keeps track of particles in such a way that particles only need scan
		their nearest neighbors to see if they are too close. 
			quadtree? 
			kd tree?
		the particles will be rapidly moving, so whatever tree I choose needs
		to be generated quickly. 

	entities:
		These are sources and sinks of particles. They are free moving, and
		try to maintain the distance between themselves, while also avoiding
		the edge of the screen. 
			use a force based algorithm. pretend there is an edge between
			every pair of entities, and that it is a spring. you can then use
			hookes law to apply forces to the entities. 
		
		These also have an age/brightness. 

This gives me two simple classes to try to implement. packets are particles
that are generated that move from one entity to another.
